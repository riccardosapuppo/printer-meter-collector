/**
 * How the control panel is served, checked against the running service.
 *
 *     npm run check:serving
 *
 * This exists because a caching header is the kind of thing that is right in
 * the source and wrong in the response, and because it was wrong here for
 * weeks. `express.static(dir, { etag: false })` reads as "no revalidation" and
 * is not: `lastModified` is a separate option that defaults to true, so every
 * file went out with a `Last-Modified`, every reload was a conditional request,
 * and a browser is entitled to answer one from its own cache with a 304.
 *
 * That is how somebody presses reload after a rebuild and is served the page
 * from before it. The advice it produces is "press Ctrl+F5", which sends people
 * looking at the server while the page is coming from their own browser.
 *
 * It asserts, against a service that is really running:
 *
 *   - the page is `no-store`, with no `ETag` and no `Last-Modified`
 *   - so is everything it loads, since nothing here is fingerprinted
 *   - a request that NAMES A FILE and has not got one is a 404, never the
 *     application dressed up as a file
